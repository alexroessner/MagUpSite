# SEO & AI Discoverability Specialist -- Site Audit Report

**Auditor:** SEO & AI Discoverability Specialist (Persona 07)
**Date:** 2026-02-11
**Site:** GEO 42 (https://alexroessner.github.io/MagUpSite)

---

## Executive Summary

The GEO 42 site has a strong SEO foundation with well-implemented structured data, proper canonical URLs, unique meta descriptions on core pages, and excellent AI discoverability files (llms.txt / llms-full.txt). However, there are several critical issues: the homepage title renders as "Home | GEO 42" in the `<title>` logic (but conditionally corrected for `/`), the OG image is an SVG file which most social platforms cannot render, the sitemap omits paginated section pages, and the `llms-full.txt` file is missing the 18 custom section pages that form the bulk of the site's content. Internal linking is solid on the homepage but weaker across subpages.

---

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### C1. OG Image Is SVG -- Social Platforms Will Not Render It
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, lines 31 and 37
- **Finding:** `og:image` and `twitter:image` point to `/images/og-image.svg`. Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter/X, and most social crawlers do not support SVG for Open Graph images. They require PNG or JPG.
- **Impact:** Social shares will show no image preview, severely reducing click-through rates from social.
- **Fix:** Convert `og-image.svg` to a 1200x630 PNG or JPG and update the meta tags.

### C2. Sitemap Omits All 18 Paginated Custom Section Pages
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/sitemap.njk`, lines 7-11
- **Finding:** The sitemap iterates over `nav.all` only. Looking at `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_data/nav.js`, `nav.all` is built from `Object.values(allPages)` which comes from the blueprint navigation. However, the 18 `custom_sections` pages generated by `sections.njk` via pagination (e.g., `/ai-visibility-brand-presence/`, `/case-study-regaining-ai-voice-share/`, `/seo-vs-geo-comparison/`, etc.) are only partially included -- only those that appear in the blueprint's `navigation.pages`. The sitemap should enumerate ALL generated URLs.
- **Impact:** Search engines may not discover or index up to 18 content-rich section pages -- the deepest, most topically-specific content on the site.
- **Fix:** Use Eleventy's `collections.all` or an explicit loop over `pageContent.custom_sections` slugs to ensure every generated page appears in the sitemap.

### C3. Homepage Title Front Matter Says "Home" -- Rendered Title Is Acceptable but OG Is Suboptimal
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/index.njk`, line 3
- **Finding:** The front matter sets `title: Home`. The base template at line 6-10 of `base.njk` correctly handles this with a special case: when `page.url == "/"`, it renders `GEO 42 -- The Answer Engine for Enterprise Brands` (55 chars -- excellent). However, the fallback title "Home | GEO 42" would be used if the conditional logic ever fails or is reused. More importantly, if any internal system (e.g., breadcrumbs in JSON-LD at line 111) references `title`, it will get the raw "Home" string, which is SEO-weak.
- **Impact:** Minor -- the homepage is handled correctly, but the raw front matter value of "Home" is fragile.
- **Fix:** Consider setting the front matter title to something like "AI Visibility Platform" or removing it entirely and using the site-level fallback consistently.

### C4. `llms-full.txt` Omits All 18 Custom Section Pages
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/llms-full.txt.njk`, lines 73-76
- **Finding:** The "Site Pages" section only iterates over `nav.all`, which does not include the 18 custom section pages. These sections contain the deepest, most detailed content on the site (service deep-dives, case studies, methodology, SEO vs GEO comparisons). AI systems consulting `llms-full.txt` will miss this content entirely.
- **Impact:** AI systems will not know about 18 of the site's most authoritative content pages.
- **Fix:** Add a "## Detailed Topics" section that iterates over `pageContent.custom_sections`, printing each title, slug URL, and content summary.

---

## Warnings (Should Fix)

### W1. No `<lastmod>` in Sitemap
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/sitemap.njk`
- **Finding:** The sitemap only includes `<loc>` elements but no `<lastmod>`, `<changefreq>`, or `<priority>` tags.
- **Impact:** Search engines cannot determine content freshness. Google uses `<lastmod>` as a crawl priority signal.
- **Fix:** Add `<lastmod>` with the build date or a per-page date.

### W2. Team Page Uses `page.njk` Layout -- No Page-Level `description` in Rendering Context
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/team.njk`, line 3
- **Finding:** The team page uses `layout: page.njk` while all other main pages use `layout: base.njk`. The `page.njk` layout wraps content in a prose container, which is fine, but the team page renders markdown output (`## {{ member.name }}`), meaning heading hierarchy starts at H1 (from `page.njk` line 5) and then jumps to H2 for each member. This is correct.
- **Note:** The description is set correctly: "GEO 42's hub-and-spoke delivery team: Project Leader, Data Analysts, Knowledge Base Architects, Content Channel Leads, and Content Operations." (154 chars -- good).

### W3. Section Pages Have Truncated Auto-Generated Descriptions
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/sections.njk`, line 10
- **Finding:** `description: "{{ section.content | truncate(155, true, '...') }}"` -- This truncates at 155 characters, which is fine for length, but the auto-generated descriptions from raw content text may not be compelling for click-through. Some sections have content that starts with the section title repeated, leading to redundant descriptions.
- **Impact:** Low CTR from SERPs for section pages. The descriptions are technically present but not optimized for human appeal.
- **Fix:** Consider adding explicit `meta_description` fields to `pageContent.json` for each custom section, or improve the truncation to skip the first sentence if it merely restates the title.

### W4. `sameAs` in Organization Schema Only Links to Self
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 76
- **Finding:** `"sameAs": ["{{ site.url }}/"]` -- The `sameAs` property should link to official social media profiles (LinkedIn, Twitter/X, etc.), not back to the site's own URL. Linking to self provides no additional signal to search engines.
- **Impact:** Missed opportunity for Google Knowledge Panel and rich entity understanding.
- **Fix:** Add social media profile URLs or remove `sameAs` if no profiles exist yet.

### W5. Organization Schema Missing `address` and `telephone`
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, lines 67-80
- **Finding:** The Organization schema has `name`, `url`, `description`, `foundingDate`, `logo`, and `email`, but no `address`, `telephone`, `areaServed`, or `numberOfEmployees`. The contact data in `pageContent.json` has an empty address and phone.
- **Impact:** Reduced eligibility for Google Knowledge Panel and reduced trust signals for E-E-A-T.
- **Fix:** When available, add `address` (PostalAddress), `telephone`, and `areaServed` to the Organization schema.

### W6. `llms.txt` Missing Author Section (Author Name Is Empty)
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/llms.txt.njk`, lines 11-15; `/home/user/MagUpUS/whitelabel.config.js`, line 13
- **Finding:** The `site.author.name` is empty string `""` in the config. The `llms.txt` template has a conditional block `{%- if site.author.name %}` that will be skipped entirely. Similarly, `llms-full.txt` skips the author section.
- **Impact:** AI systems have no information about who runs GEO 42 -- a missed E-E-A-T signal.
- **Fix:** Populate `author.name` and `author.jobTitle` in `whitelabel.config.js`.

### W7. `robots.txt` Does Not Reference `llms.txt`
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/robots.txt.njk`
- **Finding:** The robots.txt only references the sitemap. Best practice for AI discoverability is to also include a line pointing to `llms.txt`:
  ```
  # AI Discoverability
  # See also: /llms.txt
  ```
- **Impact:** AI crawlers that check robots.txt may not discover the llms.txt file.
- **Fix:** Add a comment or `Allow: /llms.txt` directive.

### W8. Index Page Title Logic Produces "Home" in JSON-LD WebPage Name
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 111
- **Finding:** `"name": "{{ title | default(site.name) }}"` -- On the homepage, `title` is "Home", so the WebPage schema name will be "Home" rather than "GEO 42" or the full branded title. This is semantically weak.
- **Impact:** Search engines see the WebPage entity named "Home" rather than a descriptive name.
- **Fix:** Add a conditional: `{% if page.url == "/" %}{{ site.name }}{% else %}{{ title | default(site.name) }}{% endif %}`.

### W9. No `<img>` Tags on Entire Site -- Zero Image SEO
- **Finding:** A search for `<img` tags across all `.njk` files returns zero results. The site has no raster images -- everything is SVG icons, CSS gradients, and canvas elements.
- **Impact:** No Google Image Search visibility. No `alt` text opportunities. While acceptable for a SaaS/platform site, image-rich content (screenshots, team photos, infographics) would significantly boost SEO.
- **Relates to:** Pending client items D3 (team photos) and D6 (client logos).

### W10. Style Guide Page Is Excluded from Collections but Indexed
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/style-guide.njk`, line 6
- **Finding:** `eleventyExcludeFromCollections: true` prevents it from appearing in collections, but there is no `noindex` meta tag. The page will still be discoverable at `/style-guide/` and indexed by search engines.
- **Impact:** A design system reference page in search results could confuse users and dilute the site's topical focus.
- **Fix:** Add `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, follow">` to the style guide, or add front matter to override the default robots meta.

## Observations (Nice to Have)

### O1. No `hreflang` Tags
- The site targets global enterprises including Chinese market clients. If localized versions are planned, `hreflang` tags should be implemented.

### O2. No Service-Level JSON-LD
- The structured data includes Organization, SoftwareApplication, WebPage, FAQPage, and BreadcrumbList. For the services page, consider adding `Service` schema for each of the 7 service pillars.

### O3. No Article Schema for Custom Section Pages
- The 18 section pages (case study, methodology, comparisons) could benefit from `Article` or `WebPage` with `speakable` schema to enhance AI discoverability in Google Discover and AI overviews.

### O4. SoftwareApplication Schema Offers Price "0"
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, lines 90-96
- **Finding:** The `offers.price` is `"0"` with description "Enterprise plans available -- contact for pricing." This could be misleading (schema says free, text says enterprise pricing).
- **Fix:** Consider using `"priceSpecification"` with a price range, or remove the price entirely and use `"availability": "https://schema.org/InStoreOnly"` to indicate "contact for pricing."

### O5. Three.js Scripts Loaded from CDN
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 58
- **Finding:** Three.js is loaded from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`. This adds a DNS lookup + connection overhead. However, it is loaded via `importmap` and only conditionally imported on desktop with pointer devices (lines 307-312), which is well-optimized.
- **Impact:** Minor. The conditional loading is excellent practice.

### O6. Google Fonts Loaded with Preload Pattern -- Good but Could Be Self-Hosted
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, lines 46-51
- **Finding:** Fonts use `rel="preload" as="style"` with `onload` fallback. This is a solid pattern. Self-hosting fonts would eliminate the Google Fonts DNS lookup and improve privacy.

### O7. No `preconnect` for jsdelivr CDN
- Three.js loads from `cdn.jsdelivr.net` but there is no `<link rel="preconnect" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net">` hint.

### O8. Section Pages Could Benefit from FAQ Schema
- Several section pages contain question-and-answer style content that could be marked up with FAQ schema.

### O9. Footer "Contact" Section Uses `<address>` Tag Correctly
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 289
- Good: The footer contact info uses the semantically correct `<address>` element.

### O10. Consider `speakable` Schema for Key Pages
- For AI discoverability, adding `speakable` structured data to the homepage and service pages would signal which content is best for voice/AI consumption.

---

## What's Working Well

### S1. Excellent Canonical URL Implementation
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 19
- `<link rel="canonical" href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}">` -- Correctly implemented on every page using the site URL + page URL. This produces clean, absolute canonical URLs.

### S2. Unique, High-Quality Meta Descriptions on Core Pages
| Page | Description | Length |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Home | "GEO 42 is the AI visibility platform that makes your brand the definitive answer across every generative engine..." | 144 chars |
| About | "GEO 42 is the AI visibility platform helping global enterprises get cited by AI answer engines." | 96 chars |
| Services | "GEO 42's 7 service pillars: AI visibility tracking, prompt intelligence, citation analytics..." | 170 chars |
| Contact | "Get in touch with GEO 42 to learn how AI visibility optimization can make your brand the top answer..." | 139 chars |
| Team | "GEO 42's hub-and-spoke delivery team: Project Leader, Data Analysts, Knowledge Base Architects..." | 154 chars |
| Style Guide | "Living design system reference -- glassmorphism components, color tokens, typography, and accessibility patterns." | 113 chars |

All core pages have unique descriptions. Services is slightly over 160 chars (170) -- minor trim needed.

### S3. Comprehensive JSON-LD Structured Data Graph
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, lines 64-200
- Implements a full `@graph` with:
  - `Organization` + `ProfessionalService` (dual-typed)
  - `SoftwareApplication` with feature list
  - `WebSite` (homepage only)
  - `WebPage` (all pages)
  - `FAQPage` with 7 questions (homepage only)
  - `BreadcrumbList` (non-homepage pages)
- The graph uses `@id` references for entity linking -- this is best practice.

### S4. Proper Heading Hierarchy on All Core Pages
| Page | H1 | H2s | H3s | Issues |
|------|-----|-----|-----|--------|
| Home (index.njk) | "Become the Answer on ChatGPT" (line 38) | SEO is Linear / GEO is Binary, Your AI Command Center, From Invisible to #1, 6 Walls Enterprises Face, The GEO 42 Platform, How Visibility Compounds, Every Dimension of AI Discovery, 90 Days Later, Every AI Engine, Tuned for Your Industry, Where We're Headed, GEO Decoded, Ready to Become the AI Answer? | Multiple per section | Single H1, logical flow |
| About | "The Answer Engine for Enterprise Brands" (line 13) | By the Numbers, Trusted By, Our Team, The Trilogy, Your Dedicated GEO Team, Ready to Get Started? | Per section | Single H1, good hierarchy |
| Services | "Full-Stack AI Visibility" (line 33) | Service names as H2s | None | Single H1, clean |
| Contact | "Ready to Become the AI Answer?" (line 15) | "See It in Action" (line 59) | None | Single H1, clean |
| Team | "GEO 42 Delivery Team" (via page.njk H1) | Member names as H2s (markdown ##) | None | Single H1, good |
| Style Guide | "Design System" (line 15) | Color Palette, Typography, Glass Cards, Buttons & Links, Section Patterns, Animations | Sub-sections as H3s | Single H1, good |
| Section pages | Section title (via page.njk H1) | Table caption as H2, Related Topics H2 | None | Single H1, good |

### S5. AI Discoverability Files Exist and Are Well-Structured
- **Files:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/llms.txt.njk` and `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/llms-full.txt.njk`
- Both files exist, use proper markdown formatting, and include company overview, services, contact info, and page links.
- `llms.txt` links to `llms-full.txt` for deeper context.
- `llms-full.txt` includes company overview, about, services with descriptions, client list, team roster, and contact info.

### S6. Excellent Font Loading Strategy
- Preconnect to `fonts.googleapis.com` and `fonts.gstatic.com`
- `rel="preload" as="style"` with `onload` fallback and `<noscript>` support
- Non-render-blocking pattern prevents layout shift

### S7. Conditional Three.js Loading
- Three.js is only loaded on desktop devices with hover capability and fine pointer, and only when `prefers-reduced-motion` is not set. This is excellent for Core Web Vitals.

### S8. Skip-to-Content Link Present
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 210
- `<a href="#main" class="skip-link">Skip to main content</a>` -- Important for accessibility, which indirectly supports SEO through improved user experience signals.

### S9. `aria-current="page"` on Navigation
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 227
- Navigation links correctly use `aria-current="page"` for the active page.

### S10. Section Pages Have Internal Related Links
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/sections.njk`, lines 54-84
- Each section page programmatically links to related sections based on keyword matching, creating an internal linking mesh among the 18 deep content pages. This is excellent for topical authority.

### S11. Section Pages Have Prev/Next Navigation
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/sections.njk`, lines 96-121
- Sequential navigation between section pages aids crawlability and encourages deeper site exploration.

### S12. Proper `lang="en"` on HTML Element
- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 2

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Title Tags -- Page-by-Page Analysis

| Page | Rendered Title | Length | Unique? | Click-worthy? |
|------|---------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| `/` | GEO 42 -- The Answer Engine for Enterprise Brands | 52 chars | Yes | Yes -- clear value prop |
| `/about/` | About GEO 42 \| GEO 42 | 23 chars | Yes | Weak -- "About" is generic |
| `/services/` | AI Visibility Services \| GEO 42 | 32 chars | Yes | Good -- descriptive |
| `/contact/` | Contact GEO 42 \| GEO 42 | 25 chars | Yes | Acceptable |
| `/team/` | GEO 42 Delivery Team \| GEO 42 | 31 chars | Yes | Good -- specific |
| `/style-guide/` | Design System \| GEO 42 | 23 chars | Yes | N/A (should be noindex) |
| Section pages | [Section Title] \| GEO 42 | Varies | Yes (unique per section) | Depends on section title |

**Issues:**
- All titles are under 60 characters -- good.
- All titles are unique -- good.
- "About GEO 42 | GEO 42" is redundant -- brand name appears twice.
- **Recommendation:** Change about page title to "About -- AI Visibility Platform | GEO 42" or "Who We Are | GEO 42".

### 2. Meta Descriptions -- Page-by-Page Analysis

**Mechanism:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 11: `<meta name="description" content="{{ description | default(site.description) }}">`

| Page | Has Custom Description? | Length | Compelling? |
|------|------------------------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | Yes | 144 | Yes -- mentions AI engines by name |
| `/about/` | Yes | 96 | Good but short |
| `/services/` | Yes | 170 | Slightly over 160 limit |
| `/contact/` | Yes | 139 | Good -- action-oriented |
| `/team/` | Yes | 154 | Good -- specific roles listed |
| `/style-guide/` | Yes | 113 | N/A |
| Section pages | Auto-generated (truncated content) | ~155 | Variable -- not optimized |
| 404 | Yes | 46 | N/A |

**Issues:**
- Services description at 170 chars will be truncated in SERPs. Trim to under 155.
- Section page descriptions are auto-truncated content, not crafted for click-through.

### 3. Structured Data -- Detailed Validation

**File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, lines 64-200

#### Organization (lines 69-80)
```json
{
  "@type": ["Organization", "ProfessionalService"],
  "@id": "{{ site.url }}/#organization",
  "name": "GEO 42",
  "url": "{{ site.url }}/",
  "description": "...",
  "foundingDate": "2025",
  "logo": "{{ site.url }}/favicon.svg",
  "sameAs": ["{{ site.url }}/"],
  "email": "hello@geo42.ai"
}
```
**Issues:**
- `sameAs` links to own URL (should be social profiles) -- W4
- `logo` is an SVG -- Google prefers PNG/JPG for Knowledge Panel -- minor
- Missing: `address`, `telephone`, `areaServed`, `numberOfEmployees` -- W5

#### SoftwareApplication (lines 82-97)
- Well-structured with `featureList`, `provider` reference, and `offers`
- `price: "0"` may be misleading -- O4

#### WebSite (lines 98-107)
- Only rendered on homepage -- correct
- Has `publisher` reference to Organization -- good

#### WebPage (lines 108-115)
- Rendered on all pages -- correct
- References `isPartOf` WebSite and `about` Organization -- good
- `name` uses raw `title` which is "Home" on homepage -- W8

#### FAQPage (lines 116-178)
- 7 well-structured Q&A pairs -- excellent
- Only on homepage -- correct
- Content matches the visible FAQ accordion -- good for consistency

#### BreadcrumbList (lines 179-197)
- Rendered on all non-homepage pages -- correct
- Two levels: Home > Current Page
- Uses `@type: ListItem` with `position`, `name`, `item` -- schema-valid

### 4. Heading Hierarchy -- Detailed Analysis

**Homepage (`/home/user/MagUpUS/src/index.njk`):**
- H1 (line 38): "Become the Answer on ChatGPT" -- single, prominent, keyword-rich
- H2s: 13 section headings, all properly using `<h2>` with `id` attributes for `aria-labelledby`
- H3s: Used within services grid and subsections -- proper hierarchy
- No heading level skips detected

**About (`/home/user/MagUpUS/src/about.njk`):**
- H1 (line 13): "The Answer Engine for Enterprise Brands"
- H2s: "By the Numbers", "Trusted By", "The People Behind the Platform", "The Trilogy: From Indexing to Recommendation", "Your Dedicated GEO Team", "Ready to Get Started?"
- H3s: "Expand Sources", "Build Reputation", "Gain Recommendations", "Project Leader"
- H4s: Role titles in delivery team
- Clean hierarchy, no skips

**Services (`/home/user/MagUpUS/src/services.njk`):**
- H1 (line 33): "Full-Stack AI Visibility"
- H2s: 7 service names via loop
- No H3s needed -- clean flat structure

**Contact (`/home/user/MagUpUS/src/contact.njk`):**
- H1 (line 15): "Ready to Become the AI Answer?"
- H2 (line 59): "See It in Action" (form heading)
- Clean and minimal

### 5. AI Discoverability Files

#### llms.txt (`/home/user/MagUpUS/src/llms.txt.njk`)
**Structure:**
1. Company name + tagline (blockquote)
2. Description
3. Services (7 bullet points with descriptions)
4. Contact (email, website)
5. Pages (links to all nav pages)
6. Link to llms-full.txt

**Issues:**
- Missing: Custom section page URLs (only nav pages listed)
- Missing: Author section (empty author name)
- Missing: Client list
- Missing: Industry information

#### llms-full.txt (`/home/user/MagUpUS/src/llms-full.txt.njk`)
**Structure:**
1. Company overview with industry and founding date
2. About the company (full paragraph)
3. Services (7 sections with ### headings)
4. Clients (13 enterprise names)
5. Team (5 roles)
6. Contact information
7. Site pages

**Issues:**
- Missing: Custom section page URLs and content summaries -- C4
- Missing: Case study details (one of the strongest content assets)
- Missing: FAQ content (could help AI systems answer questions about GEO)
- The 18 custom section pages contain the deepest topical authority content but are invisible to AI systems consulting this file.

### 6. Internal Link Graph

#### Hub Analysis (pages that link out most):
| Page | Outbound Internal Links |
|------|------------------------|
| Homepage (index.njk) | /contact/ (10+), /services/, /about/, /case-study-regaining-ai-voice-share/, /6-walls-enterprises-face-in-content-marketing/, /core-value-of-geo/, all 7 service detail pages |
| About | /services/, /contact/, /case-study-regaining-ai-voice-share/ |
| Services | /contact/, 7 individual service pages |
| Section pages | /contact/, up to 3 related section pages, prev/next section pages |

#### Navigation (all pages):
- Header: Home, Services, Case Study, About, Contact
- Footer: Home, About, Team (Company), Services (Services), up to 6 Resource links
- Mobile nav: All pages from `nav.all`

#### Orphan Page Risk:
- **Style Guide** (`/style-guide/`): Not in nav, not linked from any other page. Only accessible via direct URL. This is intentional (internal reference) but should be noindexed.
- **Team page** (`/team/`): Only linked from footer nav under "Company". Not linked from the About page or homepage. Consider adding a link from the About page.

#### Disconnected Content:
- Some section pages may receive zero incoming links from outside the section page cluster. The Related Topics and prev/next navigation create links between section pages, but the only entry points into the section cluster are:
  - Homepage: links to case study, 6 walls, core value of GEO, and 7 service detail pages
  - Services page: links to 7 service detail pages
- Section pages like "Market Size Evolution", "GEO Intelligent Dashboard", "Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard", "Industry Verticals", "Search Demand Has Not Changed..." may have limited inbound links.

### 7. Canonical URLs

- **Implementation:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, line 19
- **Pattern:** `<link rel="canonical" href="{{ site.url }}{{ page.url }}">`
- **Site URL:** `https://alexroessner.github.io/MagUpSite` (from `whitelabel.config.js`, line 34)
- **Verification:** `page.url` in Eleventy always includes leading and trailing slashes for directories, producing clean URLs like `https://alexroessner.github.io/MagUpSite/about/`
- **Status:** Correctly implemented. No duplicate content risk from canonicalization.
- **Note:** When the site moves to a custom domain (e.g., `geo42.ai`), the `siteUrl` in `whitelabel.config.js` must be updated, and 301 redirects should be set from the GitHub Pages URL.

### 8. Sitemap

- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/sitemap.njk`
- **Format:** Valid XML sitemap with `urlset` namespace
- **Pages included:** Only those in `nav.all` (core pages + blueprint navigation pages)
- **Missing:** `<lastmod>`, `<changefreq>`, `<priority>` elements
- **Missing:** Any section pages not in `nav.all`
- **Not referenced by:** llms.txt (minor)

### 9. Robots.txt

- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/robots.txt.njk`
- **Content:**
  ```
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /
  Sitemap: {{ site.url }}/sitemap.xml
  ```
- **Status:** Properly configured for full site access.
- **Missing:** Reference to `/llms.txt` for AI crawler discoverability.
- **Missing:** `Disallow: /style-guide/` (if style guide should be noindexed).

### 10. OG and Twitter Tags

- **File:** `/home/user/MagUpUS/src/_includes/base.njk`, lines 21-43
- **OG tags present:** `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`, `og:url`, `og:site_name`, `og:image`, `og:image:width`, `og:image:height`
- **Twitter tags present:** `twitter:card` (summary_large_image), `twitter:image`, `twitter:title`, `twitter:description`
- **Missing:** `twitter:site` (company Twitter handle), `twitter:creator`
- **Critical issue:** OG image is SVG -- see C1
- **OG type:** Homepage = "website", all others = "article" -- correct pattern

### 11. Page Speed Indicators

**Positive:**
- CSS is a single compiled Tailwind file (`/css/style.css`) -- single HTTP request
- JS is deferred: `<script src="/js/animations.js" defer></script>` (line 304)
- Three.js is conditionally loaded only on desktop with pointer devices (lines 307-312)
- Google Fonts use preload-as-style pattern (non-render-blocking)
- No `<img>` tags means no image optimization needed (but also no image SEO)
- `passive: true` on scroll listeners (line 345) -- good for input latency

**Concerns:**
- Three.js loaded from CDN (jsdelivr) without preconnect hint -- O7
- `importmap` script is synchronous in `<head>` (line 55) -- may block parser briefly
- No `fetchpriority` hints on critical resources
- No explicit `loading="lazy"` anywhere (no images to lazy-load)
- CSS file may contain unused styles from Tailwind (depends on build purge config)

### 12. Duplicate Content

- **Section pages via pagination:** The `sections.njk` template uses Eleventy pagination with `size: 1`, creating one unique page per custom section. Each page has unique content, unique URL, unique title, and unique (auto-generated) description. **No duplicate content risk from pagination.**
- **Repeated CTA text:** The phrase "See It in Action" appears on virtually every page as a CTA. This is branding consistency, not duplicate content.
- **About page vs. homepage:** The about page content overlaps with the homepage hero and about summary. This is normal for a corporate site and not a duplicate content issue since the pages have different purposes and unique titles/descriptions.
- **llms-full.txt vs. page content:** The llms-full.txt file reproduces content from pageContent.json, but as a `.txt` file it will not compete with HTML pages in SERPs.

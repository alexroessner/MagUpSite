## Core Messaging Framework

### The Problem (Lead With This)

> "In AI search, you are either the cited answer or you are invisible. There is no page two."

**Key tension**: SEO is linear (gradual climb). GEO is binary (cited or invisible). This binary nature is our central narrative device.

### The Proof

- 34x gap between traditional search and AI search adoption
- 1000x growth in AI chatbot traffic
- Case study: 0% → #1 Share of Voice, +450% brand mentions
- 10+ AI platforms monitored simultaneously

### The Solution

GEO 42 makes your brand the definitive answer across every generative engine.

### The Model

**Visibility Flywheel**: Become the Answer → Win Trust → Facilitate Transaction → (repeat)

|-------|------------|---------|
| **Authoritative** | We are the experts — confident, not arrogant | "GEO is binary. You are either the answer or you don't exist." |

## CTA Language

| Context | CTA Text | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| **Primary CTA** | "See It in Action" | Always this phrase — never "Book a Demo" or "Get Started" |
| **Case study link** | "View Case Study" or "Full case study" | — |
| **Section CTAs** | Action-oriented phrases | "Break through the binary", "Get coverage across all platforms" |
| **Email CTA** | `hello@geo42.ai` | Displayed as button |

---

## Section Eyebrow Labels

Every section starts with a small uppercase tracking label:

| Section | Eyebrow Text |
|---------|-------------|
| Hero | (trust signal, not a label) "Trusted by leading enterprise brands worldwide" |
| SEO vs GEO | "The Shift" |
| 6 Walls | "The Challenge" |
| Case Study | "Proven Results" |
| Product Preview | "Product Preview" |
| Flywheel | "Growth Model" |
| Services | "What We Do" |
| Dashboard | "Intelligence Dashboard" |
| Platforms | "Platform Coverage" |
| Industries | "Industries" |
| FAQ | "FAQ" |
| CTA | "Get Started" |

---

## Service Description Pattern

**Benefit-first**: [What it does for you] → [Why it matters] → [Outcome]

**Example:**
> "Know exactly where you appear — and where you don't. Real-time monitoring across 10+ AI platforms shows your brand's visibility score, citation rate, and competitive position so you can act before competitors do."

**Not:**
> "Our platform monitors brand visibility across AI platforms using advanced algorithms..."

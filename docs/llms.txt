# GEO 42

> AI Visibility Platform for 1000+ Global Enterprises

GEO 42 is the AI visibility platform that makes your brand the definitive answer across every generative engine — ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and beyond. We combine Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) with traditional SEO to maximize brand visibility across both AI answer engines and conventional search.

## What is GEO?

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) is the practice of optimizing your brand's presence in AI-generated answers. Unlike traditional SEO where you compete for page rankings, GEO is binary — you are either the cited answer or you are invisible. There is no page two in AI search.

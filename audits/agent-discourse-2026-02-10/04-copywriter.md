# GEO 42 -- Copywriter Persona: Full Copy Audit

## 1. HEADLINE AUDIT

### Strong Headlines

- **"Become the Answer on ChatGPT"** -- Grade: **A**. Active verb, specific platform, tangible outcome. The typewriter cycling through platforms is brilliant.
- **"SEO is Linear. GEO is Binary."** -- Grade: **A**. Memorable, provocative, educational. Creates a mental model immediately.
- **"You're either the Answer — or you don't exist"** -- Grade: **A-**. Dramatic escalation of the binary concept.

### Weak Headlines

- **"We Have the Answers"** (FAQ section) -- Grade: **D**. Tone-deaf. Sounds smug in a section designed to build trust. Rewrite: "Your Questions About AI Visibility, Answered"
- **"Transform Your AI Presence"** (CTA) -- Grade: **C+**. Generic. Could be any AI company.
- Service card headlines are spec-sheet labels, not benefit-driven hooks.

## 2. CREDIBILITY RISKS

### Critical

- **"1,000+ enterprises"** -- The single highest-risk copy element on the site. If this number is not verifiable, it should be removed or softened to "Leading enterprises across 4 industries."
- **Fortune 500 logo wall** (HP, Ford, Nike, McDonald's, Samsung, Amazon) -- These are extraordinary claims. Text-only rendering without verification feels like name-dropping.

### High

- **Anonymous case study** -- "Robot vacuum brand" is thin. Enterprise buyers need a real company name, a real timeline, real before/after metrics with dates.
- **No testimonials** -- The data layer has an empty array. This is the most impactful missing element.

## 3. COPY QUALITY ISSUES

### Translated-from-Chinese Phrasing

Multiple passages read as translated grammar:
- "efficiently acquire customers" -- awkward passive construction
- "Ensure Being Found/Recognized/Adopted" -- capitalized gerund list feels like slide deck translation
- Service descriptions use spec-sheet language rather than marketing benefit framing

### CTA Inconsistencies

- "View Case Study" vs "See Case Study" -- pick one verb
- Hero CTA uses `rounded-full` gradient pill
- Inner page CTAs use `rounded-xl` solid with dark text
- Three distinct visual patterns for the same action type

### Service Descriptions

All 7 are run-on feature lists with no benefit framing. They read like spec sheets, not marketing copy. Each should follow:
**[What it does] → [Why it matters to you] → [Specific outcome]**

## 4. MISSING COPY ELEMENTS

1. **Product clarity statement** -- "GEO 42 is a [managed service/SaaS platform/agency] that..."
2. **Methodology bridge** -- HOW does the optimization actually work? 3-step summary.
3. **Pricing/engagement signal** -- Even "Enterprise plans starting from..." gives visitors context.
4. **Social proof copy** -- Testimonial quotes, case study attribution, client logos with context.
5. **FAQ expansion** -- 7 items is good, but answers need more depth and specificity.

---

## 5. RECOMMENDATIONS

1. **Rewrite FAQ headline** to "Your Questions About AI Visibility, Answered"
2. **Substantiate or remove "1,000+ enterprises"** -- highest credibility risk
3. **Add benefit framing to all 7 service descriptions**
4. **Fix translated phrasing** throughout ("efficiently acquire customers" → active voice)
5. **Unify CTA verb and visual pattern** across all pages
6. **Add og:image** -- every social share renders blank
7. **Add product clarity statement** in hero or immediately after
